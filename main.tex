\abstract{
    This dissertation explores
    creating a set of domain-specific learning materials for the biomedical sciences
    to meet the the educational gap in biomedical informatics,
    while also meeting the call for statisticians advocating for process improvements in other disciplines.
    Data science educational materials are plenty enough to become commodity.
    This provides the opportunity to create domain-specific learning materials
    to better motivate learning using real-world examples
    while also capturing intricacies of working with data in a specific domain.
    This dissertation shows how the use of persona methodologies can be combined
    with a backwards design approach of creating domain-specific learning materials.
    The work is divided into three (3) major steps:
    (1) create and validate a learner self-assessment survey that can identify learner personas by clustering.
    (2) combine the information from persona methodology with a backwards design approach
        using formative and summative assessments
        to curate, plan, and assess domain-specific data science
        workshop materials for short term and long term efficacy.
    (3) pilot and identify at how to manage real-time feedback within a
        data coding teaching session to drive better learner motivation and engagement.
    The key findings from this dissertation suggests using a structured framework to
    plan and curate learning materials is an effective way to identify key concepts
    in data science. However, just creating and teaching learning materials is not
    enough for long-term retention of knowledge. More effort for long-term lesson
    maintenance and long-term strategies for practice will help retain the concepts
    learned from live instruction. Finally, it is essential that we are careful
    and purposeful in our content creation as to not overwhelm learners and to
    integrate their needs into the materials as a primary focus.
    Overall, this contributes to the growing need for data science education
    in the biomedical sciences to train future clinicians use and work with data
    and improve patient outcomes.

\abstractgenaud{
    Regardless of the field and domain you are in, we are all
    inundated with data. The more agency we can give individuals to work with data,
    the better equipped they will be to bring their own expertise to complex
    problems and work in multidisciplinary teams. There already exists a plethora
    of data science learning materials to help learners work with data; however,
    many are not domain-focused and can be overwhelming to new learners. By
    integrating in domain specificity to data science education, we hypothesize that
    we can help learners learn and retain knowledge by keeping them more engaged and
    motivated. This dissertation focuses on the domain of the biomedical sciences to
    use best practices on how to improve data science education and impact the
    field. Specifically, we explore how to address major gaps in data education in
    the biomedical field and create a set of domain-specific learning materials
    (e.g. workshops) for the biomedical sciences. We use best educational practices
    to curate these learning materials and assess how effective they are. This
    assessment was performed in three (3) major steps including: (1) identify who the
    learners are and what they already know in the context of using a programming
    language to work with data, (2) plan and curate a learning path for the
    learners and assessing materials created for short and long term effectiveness,
    and (3) pilot and identify at how to manage real-time feedback within a
    data coding teaching session to drive better learner motivation and engagement.
    The key findings from this dissertation suggests using a structured framework to
    plan and curate learning materials is an effective way to identify key concepts
    in data science. However, just creating the materials and teaching them is not
    enough for long-term retention of knowledge. More effort for long-term lesson
    maintenance and long-term strategies for practice will help retain the concepts
    learned from live instruction. Finally, it is essential that we are careful
    and purposeful in our content creation as to not overwhelm learners and to

% Below are some general suggestions for writing your dissertation:
%
% 1. Label everything with a meaningful prefix so that you
%    can refer back to sections, tables, figures, equations, etc.
%    Usage \label{<prefix>:<label_name>} where some suggested
%    prefixes are:
%            ch: Chapter
%             se: Section
%             ss: Subsection
%             sss: Sub-subsection
%            app: Appendix
%             ase: Appendix section
%             tab: Tables
%             fig: Figures
%             sfig: Sub-figures
%             eq: Equations
%
% 2. The VTthesis class provides for natbib citations. You should upload
%     one or more *.bib bibtex files. Suppose you have two bib files: some_refs.bib and
%    other_refs.bib.  Then your bibliography line to include them
%    will be:
%      \bibliography{some_refs, other_refs}
%    where multiple files are separated by commas. In the body of
%    your work, you can cite your references using natbib citations.
%    Examples:
%      Citation                     Output
%      -------------------------------------------------------
%      \cite{doe_title_2016}        [18]
