\subsubsection{Summative assessment}

    \paragraph{Q5.1}

    Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus that normally does not cause any
    problems in the body. However, it can be of concern for those who are
    pregnant or immunocompromised.

    Suppose you have the following Cytomegalovirus dataset [1] of CMV reactivation
    among patients after Allogenetic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) in an
    excel sheet (first 10 rows shown below):

    It contains a patient's: ID age priror.radiation: whether or not patient had
    prior radiation treatment (0 = no, 1 = yes) aKIRs: Number of donor activating
    killer immunoglobulin-link receptors donor\_negative: the recipient's CMV status
    when the donor was CMV negative donor\_positive: the recipient's CMV status when
    the donor was CMV positive

    It is believed that the donor activating KIR genotype is a contributing factor
    for CMV reactivation after myeloablastive allogenetic HSCT. You want to do some
    data analysis to see what variables are associated with CMV reactivation.

    Assuming this is the version of the data you need for the tidying, plotting, and
    modeling:

    How would you rate your ability to accomplish the following tasks:

    [1]: Sobecks et al. ``Cytomegalovirus Reactivation After Matched Sibling
    DonorReduced-Intensity Conditioning Allogeneic HematopoieticStem Cell Transplant
    Correlates With Donor KillerImmunoglobulin-like Receptor Genotype''. Exp Clin
    Transplant2011; 1: 7-13.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item I wouldnâ€™t know where to start (4)
        \item I could struggle through, but not confident I could do it (5)
        \item I could struggle through by trial and error with a lot of web searches (6)
        \item I could do it quickly with little or no use of external help (7)
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Load the excel sheet into R (1)
        \item Filter the data for individuals over the age of 65 (in R) (2)
        \item Save filtered dataset (in R) as an Excel file to send to a colleague (6)
        \item Tidy the dataset (in R) so we have a donor CMV status and a patient CMV status in separate columns (3)
        \item Plot a histogram (in R) of the age distribution of our data (4)
        \item Fit a model (e.g., logistic regression) to see which variables are associated with patient CMV reactivation  (in R) (5)
    \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Workshop Content}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item 1 day 4-5 hour workshop on the weekday  (1)
        \item 1 day 4-5 hour workshop on the weekend  (2)
        \item 2 days about 2-3 hours each on the weekday  (3)
        \item 2 days about 2-3 hours each on the weekday  (4)
