\subsubsection{Persona}

\paragraph{Q3.1}

Which of the below personas do you most identify with? Be less concerned about the actual occupation, and more with what relates to your skill and workshop needs.

More detailed descriptions of Alex Academic, Clare Clinician, Patricia Programmer, and Samir Student can be found here: https://ds4biomed.tech/who-is-this-book-for.html


\textbf{Alex Academic}

 Alex performs their research using a combination of Excel spreadsheets and specialized software,
 but is switching to R or Python (which they taught themself during a sabbatical).
 They have never taken a formal programming course, and suffers from impostor syndrome in discussions about programming.
 Alex would like to learn more about how programming can help their research and keep up with the tools their students are learning in class.

 Alex needs workshops (so they can allocate focused time) and how-to guides (for research).
 They would like ready-to-use lesson material that could be remixed for their students and some orientation material to demystify jargon (what is "tidy data"?).
 Alex also wants to be able to use the same tools in their research as in their teaching to amortize learning costs and stay in practice.

\textbf{Clare Clinician}

 Clare keeps up with medical research, but has little to no experience in doing medical research.
 They use Excel for non-data related tasks (e.g., making lists), or manually inputting patient data into spreadsheets for chart reviews.
 Wants to be able to collect and manage data as well as learn about the process behind data analysis to perform their own analysis and study one day.

Clare wants self-paced tutorials with practice exercises, plus forums where they can ask for help.
 They also need short overviews to orient them and introductory tutorials that include videos or animated GIFs showing exactly how to drive the tools,
 and that use datasets they can relate to.
 Clare wishes they had a community of other people in the medical field who are interested in learning how to do data work so they can learn and ask questions.

\textbf{Patricia Programmer}

 Patricia regularly connects to a remote server to do their work.
 They write SQL statements to pull data out of Epic and processes the data in both Python and R to generate reports and dashboards for their team and management.
 Patricia writes data pipelines for all their work either by combining shell scripts or build scripts.

 Patricia wants how-to guides and reference material for their day-to-day work
 and short, intensive online training for very specific topics.
 Because they often jump around between various tools, Patricia wants a way to quickly review topics before starting a new project.

\textbf{Samir Student}

 Samir is fairly proficient in Excel and does works with spreadsheets regularly and
 knows how to load up Excel spreadsheets into R and do basic data processing and analysis.
 However, they do not have that much practice outside of a classroom homework and project setting,
 and spends a lot of their time on StackOverflow copying and pasting code so they don't consider themselves a "real programmer".
 They have no problem getting their work done, but usually involves a lot of googling to eventually get the solution.

 Samir wants a formal workshop and reference materials that can be used to build a good foundation of the programming skills they were never taught.
 They want a better understanding of the terminology and jargon used in data science so they have the vocabulary to
 search for and understand solutions posted online. They are also looking for a community to help in their growth as a student in this domain.

        \item I have installed it, but have only done simple examples with them  (3)
        \item I have written a small program with them before  (4)
        \item I use it to automate certain repetitive tasks  (5)
        \item I have small side projects that I program in it  (6)

    \paragraph{Q4.2}

    Are you familiar with the term ``tidy data''?

    \paragraph{Q4.3}

    If you were given a dateset containing an individual's smoking status
    (binary variable) and whether or not they have hypertension (binary variable),

    if smoking has an increased relative risk or odds of hypertension? Any
    type of model will suffice.

        \item I wouldn't know where to start  (1)
        \item I could struggle through, but not confident I could do it  (4)
