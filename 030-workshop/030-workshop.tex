    \section{Discussion}

        Survey response rates were generally not high enough to make definitive conclusions.

        The lesson materials were created using learner personas.
        While, not directly measured in the inibial persona survey,
        thinking about learner's special considerations helped make the materials
        more accessiable,
        and has helped with improving the greater open access set of materials.

        One of the main limitations with the survey responses is there
        are no graded summative assessment question.
        All the responses to the learning objectives are self-reported conficence in task completion.
        The actual summative assessment question was not graded,
        or were participants asked to provide code to solve the data challenge.
