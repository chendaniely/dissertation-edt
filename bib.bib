  abstract = {To the Editor On behalf of our coauthors, we write to report a programming error and other errors that affected the results in our article, ``Effect of a Program Combining Transitional Care and Long-term Self-management Support on Outcomes of Hospitalized Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial'' published in the December 11, 2018, issue of JAMA. We write to explain what happened and to request retraction of this article.In this study, we had tested a 3-month hospital-initiated program that combined transition and long-term management support for patients hospitalized for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We had originally reported that the intervention, compared with usual care, resulted in a fewer number of mean COPD-related hospitalizations and emergency department visits at 6 months per participant (0.72 [95\% CI, 0.45-0.97] vs 1.40 [95\% CI, 1.01-1.79]) and an adjusted difference in the 100-point St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score between groups of -6.69 (95\% CI, -12.97 to -0.40; P\,=\,.04). The correct results reverse the main finding to more COPD-related hospitalizations and emergency department visits in the intervention group vs the usual care group (1.40 [95\% CI, 1.10-1.79] vs 0.72 [95\% CI, 0.46-0.97]) and an adjusted difference in the SGRQ score that is no longer statistically different (5.18 [95\% CI, -2.15 to 12.51]; P\,=\,.11). Here we describe the detected errors and the additional analyses that have been conducted.}

  abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are widely used to deliver specialized education and training in different fields. Determining the effectiveness of these courses is an integral part of delivering comprehensive, high-quality learning. This study is an evaluation of a MOOC offered by Imperial College London in collaboration with Health iQ called, Data Science Essentials: Real World Evidence. The paper analyzes the reported learning outcomes, attitudes and behaviours of students after completing the MOOC. The study used mixed-methods, drawing from a Kirkpatrick evaluation-using data from semi-structured interviews transcribed and analyzed through Braun and Clark's method for thematic coding. 191 learners joined the MOOC. Two participants who completed at least 75\% of the course were interviewed for the course evaluation. The findings of the analysis suggest that the course attracted target learners and learners found its application and engagement methods effective. Learners found the training provided by the MOOC to be helpful and with the potential to be applied in their work environment in the future and identified some work-related barriers that prevent knowledge application. Networking during and post-MOOC was identified as an area that needs improvement and development in the future. Findings derived from this evaluation support the fact that generally, MOOCs can improve learning and knowledge attainment in practical skills-based knowledge. One implication of this study is to inform factors that engage learners in the design and implementation of MOOC. The findings have shown that factors that affect the learners' engagement are the availability of lecture videos, self-assessment tools and high networking and communication between learners. In terms of knowledge application, support and availability of the right resources are essential because learners are not able to apply learning in their workplace if the workplace lacked the right resources and support. Developers of MOOCs for continuing professional development should take into consideration work-related barriers when designing their MOOCs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

The data suggest that participants based metacomprehension judgments more on the gist of texts when they generated summaries after a delay; whereas, they based judgments more on details when they generated summaries immediately after reading. Focusing on information relevant to the situation model of a text (the gist of a text) produced higher levels of metacomprehension accuracy, which is consistent with situation model hypothesis.},

Interest in CI training opportunities (medical school electives, residency electives, or academic fellowships) surpassed respondents' prior awareness of these opportunities. Thirty percent of student respondents expressed at least some interest in a CI-related career, but they were no more aware of training opportunities than their peers who did not express such an interest.Discussion Almost one third of medical students who responded to our survey expressed an interest in a CI-related career, but they were generally unaware of CI training and mentoring opportunities available to them. Early outreach to such medical students, through elective classes, professional society incentives, or expert partnerships, may positively influence the size and skill set of the future CI workforce.Conclusion We should work as a field to increase the quantity, quality, and publicity of CI learning opportunities for interested medical students.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The movement of evidence-based practices (EBPs) into routine clinical usage is not spontaneous, but requires focused efforts. The field of implementation science has developed to facilitate the spread of EBPs, including both psychosocial and medical interventions for mental and physical health concerns. DISCUSSION: The authors aim to introduce implementation science principles to non-specialist investigators, administrators, and policymakers seeking to become familiar with this emerging field. This introduction is based on published literature and the authors' experience as researchers in the field, as well as extensive service as implementation science grant reviewers. Implementation science is "the scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other EBPs into routine practice, and, hence, to improve the quality and effectiveness of health services." Implementation science is distinct from, but shares characteristics with, both quality improvement and dissemination methods. Implementation studies can be either assess naturalistic variability or measure change in response to planned intervention. Implementation studies typically employ mixed quantitative-qualitative designs, identifying factors that impact uptake across multiple levels, including patient, provider, clinic, facility, organization, and often the broader community and policy environment. Accordingly, implementation science requires a solid grounding in theory and the involvement of trans-disciplinary research teams. The business case for implementation science is clear: As healthcare systems work under increasingly dynamic and resource-constrained conditions, evidence-based strategies are essential in order to ensure that research investments maximize healthcare value and improve public health. Implementation science plays a critical role in supporting these efforts.},

The skill of involvement and the development of moral agency are linked with the development of expertise, and change as the practitioner becomes more skillful. Nurses who had some difficulty with understanding the ends of practice and difficulty with their skills of interpersonal and problem engagement did not progress to the level of expertise.

A physical (non-virtual) underground mine mapping simulation in a building on the Adams State College campus in Alamosa, Colorado, provides an excellent cost-effective and efficient learning tool to prepare students for actual field mapping, while improving spatial thinking using a physical hands-on setting. In this simulation students act as mine geologists, completing simulated mine mapping work tasks. Mapping and interpretive skills are enhanced in an adaptable, flexible, and easily implemented simulation that is software independent. The mine simulation is well received by students as an effective training and learning tool.},

Using the open source Pandas library, you can use Python to rapidly automate and perform virtually any data analysis task, no matter how large or complex. Pandas can help you ensure the veracity of your data, visualize it for effective decision-making, and reliably reproduce analyses across multiple datasets. ~ Pandas for Everyone brings together practical knowledge and insight for solving real problems with Pandas, even if you're new to Python data analysis. Daniel Y. Chen introduces key concepts through simple but practical examples, incrementally building on them to solve more difficult, real-world problems. ~ Chen gives you a jumpstart on using Pandas with a realistic dataset and covers combining datasets, handling missing data, and structuring datasets for easier analysis and visualization. He demonstrates powerful data cleaning techniques, from basic string manipulation to applying functions simultaneously across dataframes. ~ Once your data is ready, Chen guides you through fitting models for prediction, clustering, inference, and exploration. He provides tips on performance and scalability, and introduces you to the wider Python data analysis ecosystem.~   Work with DataFrames and Series, and import or export data Create plots with matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas Combine datasets and handle missing data Reshape, tidy, and clean datasets so they're easier to work with Convert data types and manipulate text strings Apply functions to scale data manipulations Aggregate, transform, and filter large datasets with groupby Leverage Pandas' advanced date and time capabilities Fit linear models using statsmodels and scikit-learn libraries Use generalized linear modeling to fit models with different response variables Compare multiple models to select the ``best'' Regularize to overcome overfitting and improve performance Use clustering in unsupervised machine learning},

  abstract = {Many students are being left behind by an educational system that some people believe is in crisis. Improving educational outcomes will require efforts on many fronts, but a central premise of this monograph is that one part of a solution involves helping students to better regulate their learning through the use of effective learning techniques. Fortunately, cognitive and educational psychologists have been developing and evaluating easy-to-use learning techniques that could help students achieve their learning goals. In this monograph, we discuss 10 learning techniques in detail and offer recommendations about their relative utility. We selected techniques that were expected to be relatively easy to use and hence could be adopted by many students. Also, some techniques (e.g., highlighting and rereading) were selected because students report relying heavily on them, which makes it especially important to examine how well they work. The techniques include elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, summarization, highlighting (or underlining), the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, rereading, practice testing, distributed practice, and interleaved practice., To offer recommendations about the relative utility of these techniques, we evaluated whether their benefits generalize across four categories of variables: learning conditions, student characteristics, materials, and criterion tasks. Learning conditions include aspects of the learning environment in which the technique is implemented, such as whether a student studies alone or with a group. Student characteristics include variables such as age, ability, and level of prior knowledge. Materials vary from simple concepts to mathematical problems to complicated science texts. Criterion tasks include different outcome measures that are relevant to student achievement, such as those tapping memory, problem solving, and comprehension., We attempted to provide thorough reviews for each technique, so this monograph is rather lengthy. However, we also wrote the monograph in a modular fashion, so it is easy to use. In particular, each review is divided into the following sections: , , The review for each technique can be read independently of the others, and particular variables of interest can be easily compared across techniques., To foreshadow our final recommendations, the techniques vary widely with respect to their generalizability and promise for improving student learning. Practice testing and distributed practice received high utility assessments because they benefit learners of different ages and abilities and have been shown to boost students' performance across many criterion tasks and even in educational contexts. Elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, and interleaved practice received moderate utility assessments. The benefits of these techniques do generalize across some variables, yet despite their promise, they fell short of a high utility assessment because the evidence for their efficacy is limited. For instance, elaborative interrogation and self-explanation have not been adequately evaluated in educational contexts, and the benefits of interleaving have just begun to be systematically explored, so the ultimate effectiveness of these techniques is currently unknown. Nevertheless, the techniques that received moderate-utility ratings show enough promise for us to recommend their use in appropriate situations, which we describe in detail within the review of each technique., Five techniques received a low utility assessment: summarization, highlighting, the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, and rereading. These techniques were rated as low utility for numerous reasons. Summarization and imagery use for text learning have been shown to help some students on some criterion tasks, yet the conditions under which these techniques produce benefits are limited, and much research is still needed to fully explore their overall effectiveness. The keyword mnemonic is difficult to implement in some contexts, and it appears to benefit students for a limited number of materials and for short retention intervals. Most students report rereading and highlighting, yet these techniques do not consistently boost students' performance, so other techniques should be used in their place (e.g., practice testing instead of rereading)., Our hope is that this monograph will foster improvements in student learning, not only by showcasing which learning techniques are likely to have the most generalizable effects but also by encouraging researchers to continue investigating the most promising techniques. Accordingly, in our closing remarks, we discuss some issues for how these techniques could be implemented by teachers and students, and we highlight directions for future research.},

The focus is on extramurally funded programs that have a national or international impact rather than the training of NIH staff, which was addressed by the NIH's internal Data Science Workforce Development Center. From its inception, the major goal of BD2K was to narrow the gap between needed and existing biomedical data science skills. As biomedical research increasingly relies on computational, mathematical, and statistical thinking, supporting the training and education of the workforce of tomorrow requires new emphases on analytical skills. From 2013 to 2016, BD2K jump-started training in this area for all levels, from graduate students to senior researchers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {Over 25 years ago Ericsson et al. (1993) published the results of their search for the most effective forms of training in music, a domain where knowledge of effective training has been accumulated over centuries. At music academies master teachers provide students individualized instruction and help them identify goals and methods for their practice sessions between meetings \textendash{} this form of solitary practice was named deliberate practice, and its accumulated duration during development was found to distinguish groups with differing levels of attained music performance. In an influential meta-analysis Macnamara et al. (2014) identified studies that had collected estimates of practice accumulated during development and attained performance and reported that individual differences in deliberate practice accounted for only 14\% of variance in performance. Their definition of ``deliberate practice'' differs significantly from the original definition of deliberate practice and will henceforth be referred to as structured practice. We explicate three criteria for reproducible performance and purposeful/deliberate practice and exclude all effect sizes considered by Macnamara et al. (2014) that were based on data not meeting these criteria. A reanalysis of the remaining effects estimated that accumulated duration of practice explained considerably more variance in performance (29 and 61\% after attenuation correction). We also address the argument that the limited amount of variance explained by the duration of practice necessarily implies an important role of genetic factors, and we report that genetic effects have so far accounted for remarkably small amounts of variance \textendash{} with exception of genetic influences of height and body size. The paper concludes with recommendations for how future research on purposeful and deliberate practice can go beyond recording only the duration of practice to measuring the quality of practice involving concentration, analysis, and problem solving to identify conditions for the most effective forms of training.},

Laboratory analyses of expert performance in many domains such as chess, medicine, auditing, computer programming, bridge, physics, sports, typing, juggling, dance, and music reveal maximal adaptations of experts to domain-specific constraints. For example, acquired anticipatory skills circumvent general limits on reaction time, and distinctive memory skills allow a domain-specific expansion of working memory capacity to support planning, reasoning, and evaluation. Many of the mechanisms of superior expert performance serve the dual purpose of mediating experts' current performance and of allowing continued improvement of this performance in response to informative feedback during practice activities.},

The analysis of long-term and high-frequency sensor data combined with simulation modeling enables interpretation of complex ecological phenomena, and the computational skills needed to conduct these analyses are increasingly being integrated into graduate student training programs in ecology. Despite its importance, however, computational literacy\textemdash that is, the ability to harness the power of computer technologies to accomplish tasks\textemdash is rarely taught in undergraduate ecology classrooms, representing a major gap in training students to tackle complex environmental challenges. Through our experience developing undergraduate curricula in long-term and high-frequency data analysis and simulation modeling for two environmental science pedagogical initiatives, Project EDDIE (Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry and Exploration) and Macrosystems EDDIE, we have found that students often feel intimidated by computational tasks, which is compounded by the lack of familiarity with software (e.g., R) and the steep learning curves associated with script-based analytical tools. The use of prepackaged, flexible modules that introduce programming as a mechanism to explore environmental datasets and teach inquiry-based ecology, such as those developed for Project EDDIE and Macrosystems EDDIE, can significantly increase students' experience and comfort levels with advanced computational tools. These types of modules in turn provide great potential for empowering students with the computational literacy needed to ask ecological questions and test hypotheses on their own. As continental-scale sensor observatory networks rapidly expand the availability of long-term and high-frequency data, students with the skills to manipulate, visualize, and interpret such data will be well-prepared for diverse careers in data science, and will help advance the future of open, reproducible science in ecology.},

  abstract = {To increase the effectiveness of graduate research training, many universities have introduced boot camps and bridge programs lasting several days to several weeks. National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health currently support such interventions with nearly \$28 million in active awards. Previous evidence for the efficacy of this format exists primarily in the form of anecdotes and end-of-course surveys. Here we show that participation in such short-format interventions is not associated with observable benefits related to skill development, scholarly productivity, or socialization into the academic community. Analyzing data from 294 PhD students in life sciences from 53 US institutions, we found no evidence of effectiveness across 115 variables. We conclude that boot camps and other short formats may not durably impact student outcomes., Many PhD programs incorporate boot camps and summer bridge programs to accelerate the development of doctoral students' research skills and acculturation into their respective disciplines. These brief, high-intensity experiences span no more than several weeks and are typically designed to expose graduate students to data analysis techniques, to develop scientific writing skills, and to better embed incoming students into the scholarly community. However, there is no previous study that directly measures the outcomes of PhD students who participate in such programs and compares them to the outcomes of students who did not participate. Likewise, no previous study has used a longitudinal design to assess these outcomes over time. Here we show that participation in such programs is not associated with detectable benefits related to skill development, socialization into the academic community, or scholarly productivity for students in our sample. Analyzing data from 294 PhD students in the life sciences from 53 US institutions, we found no statistically significant differences in outcomes between participants and nonparticipants across 115 variables. These results stand in contrast to prior studies presenting boot camps as effective interventions based on participant satisfaction and perceived value. Many universities and government agencies (e.g., National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation) invest substantial resources in boot camp and summer bridge activities in the hopes of better supporting scientific workforce development. Our findings do not reveal any measurable benefits to students, indicating that an allocation of limited resources to alternative strategies with stronger empirical foundations warrants consideration.},

This is a gem of a book that every college teacher should read." \textemdash Ken Bain, author, What the Best College Students Do Since the original publication of L. Dee Fink's Creating Significant Learning Experiences, higher education has continued to move in two opposite directions: more institutions encourage faculty to focus on research, obtaining grants, and publishing, while accreditation agencies, policy-makers, and students themselves emphasize the need for greater attention to the quality of teaching and learning. Now the author has updated his bestselling classic, providing busy faculty with invaluable conceptual and procedural tools for instructional design. Step by step, Fink shows how to use a taxonomy of significant learning and systematically combine the best research-based practices for learning-centered teaching with a teaching strategy in a way that results in powerful learning experiences. This edition addresses new research on how people learn, active learning, and student engagement; includes illustrative examples from online teaching; and reports on the effectiveness of Fink's time-tested model. Fink also explores recent changes in higher education nationally and internationally and offers more proven strategies for dealing with student resistance to innovative teaching. Tapping into the knowledge, tools, and strategies in Creating Significant Learning Experiences empowers educators to creatively design courses that will result in significant learning for their students. "As thought-provoking and inspiring today as it was when it was first published, it is a 'must' for anyone serious about creating courses that challenge students to learn deeply." \textemdash Elizabeth F.

As information technologies supporting clinical documentation continue to advance, the volume of clinical data generated in the natural course of care rapidly grows. Understanding, accessing, managing, and interpreting the widening variety of healthcare data available requires coordination of resources, efforts, and incentives to ensure that researchers, clinicians, and patients have access to the right data, in the right context, at the right time (Detmer, 2003; Kawamoto and Ginsburg, 2009; NRC, 2009). Integrated datasets and other approaches to link data and broaden or share findings only extend the potential to use these data to learn what works in health care. Fostering broader access to and appropriate use of these data will be key to progress\textemdash and will require both cross-sector discussions to better characterize the technical, organizational, and legal barriers that currently limit the use of existing and emerging data resources and cooperative action to address these challenges (Arrow et al., 2009; Piwowar et al., 2008).

In recent years, a number of peer-reviewed articles have addressed different dimensions of data mining application in healthcare. However, the lack of a comprehensive and systematic narrative motivated us to construct a literature review on this topic. In this paper, we present a review of the literature on healthcare analytics using data mining and big data. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a database search between 2005 and 2016. Critical elements of the selected studies\&mdash;healthcare sub-areas, data mining techniques, types of analytics, data, and data sources\&mdash;were extracted to provide a systematic view of development in this field and possible future directions. We found that the existing literature mostly examines analytics in clinical and administrative decision-making. Use of human-generated data is predominant considering the wide adoption of Electronic Medical Record in clinical care. However, analytics based on website and social media data has been increasing in recent years. Lack of prescriptive analytics in practice and integration of domain expert knowledge in the decision-making process emphasizes the necessity of future research.},

The mission of Data Carpentry is to provide researchers high-quality, domain-specific training covering the full lifecycle of data-driven research. This mission is achieved through the development and implementation of workshops taught on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research. Data Carpentry is a sibling organization of Software Carpentry, though its focus is on the introductory computational skills needed for data management and analysis in all domains of research. Data Carpentry lessons are domain specific, and range from life and physical sciences to social science. Lessons build upon the existing knowledge of learners to enable them to quickly apply the skills they learn to their own research. Data Carpentry learners are asked to complete pre- and post-workshop surveys. This report is an analysis of the post-workshop survey responses collected for 40 Data Carpentry workshop sites. Purpose The analysis in this report serves the following purposes: To inform the community of the impact Data Carpentry workshops have made on its learners.

However, the available software for implementing and disseminating such surveys lacks flexibility, stifling researcher creativity and severely limiting the scope of questions that survey research can address. In this paper I introduce the use of R Shiny, an open source web application and scripting language, for implementing powerful, innovative, and fully customizable surveys. Through six applications rooted in important questions in political science, I show that R Shiny allows for (1) randomized question selection, (2) programmatic treatments, (3) programmatic survey flow, (4) adaptive question batteries, (5) sequentially block-randomized design, and (6) randomized intracoder reliability tests, expanding the scope, ease, and cost effectiveness of online survey research. I make all replication code available online.},

Many of these data flows are routinely captured through administrative records, social media, and surveys. Historically, agencies at different levels of government have been responsible for curating and reporting statistics about our social, economic, and health conditions associated with these data flows. Recently, the U.S. government has proposed the use of data derived from administrative records at the federal level to support social policy and program evaluation. Why not consider parallel activities at state and local levels? Harnessing local data sources and integrating them with state and federal sources will provide timelier and more geographically specific analyses to support local insights and policy development. Leveraging community-based participatory research, researchers and civic leaders can work together to identify the questions and execute rigorous, yet flexible, processes for building local sustainable community learning cultures based on data-driven discovery. In the process of conducting research with local civic leaders, we have observed that issues can be classified into 3 categories: locating and describing a population within a community; estimating a statistic and a measure of variability; and evaluating a program, policy, or procedure. Through a series of case studies, this paper demonstrates the unexpected value in liberating and repurposing local data.

Therefore, this paper reviews the issue of what sample size and sample power the researcher should have in the EFA, CFA, and SEM study. Statistical power is the estimation of the sample size that is appropriate for an analysis. In any study, four parameters related to power analysis are Alpha, Beta, statistical power and Effect size. They are prerequisites for a priori sample size determination. Scale development in general and Factor Analysis (EFA, CFA) and SEM are large sample size methods because sample affects precision and replicability of the results. However, the existing literature provides limited and sometimes conflicting guidance on this issue. Generally, for EFA the stronger the data, the smaller the sample can be for an accurate analysis. In CFA and SEM parameter estimates, chi-square tests and goodness of fit indices are equally sensitive to sample size. So the statistical power and precision of CFA/SEM parameter estimates are also influenced by sample size. In this work after reviewing existing sample power analysis rules along with more elaborated methods (like Monte Carlo simulation), we conclude with suggestions for small samples in factor analysis found in literature.},

Factors most strongly associated with substantially greater risk of and earlier hospitalization included male gender, history of hospitalization, polypharmacy, elevated depressive symptoms, greater functional disability, primary diagnoses of heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and urinary tract infection, and government-controlled agency care. In addition to these factors, black race and primary diagnosis of skin wounds were uniquely related to risk of earlier re-hospitalization.{$<$}bold{$>$}Conclusions: {$<$}/bold{$>$}Results suggest that factors collected during routine HH patient assessments can provide important information to predict risk of earlier hospitalization and re-hospitalization among Medicare HH patients. Identified factors can help identify patients at greatest risk of early hospitalization and may be important targets for agencies and care providers to prevent avoidable hospitalizations.

Recent innovations in population-level data collection and storage have made available an unprecedented amount of data for analysis while computational technology has evolved to permit processing of data previously thought too dense to study. "Big data" is a term used to describe data that are a combination of dramatically greater volume, complexity, and scale. The number of variables in typical big data research can readily be in the thousands, challenging the limits of traditional research methodologies. Regardless of what it is called, advanced data methods, predictive analytics, or big data, this unprecedented revolution in scientific exploration has the potential to dramatically assist research in obstetrics and gynecology broadly across subject matter. Before implementation of big data research methodologies, however, potential researchers and reviewers should be aware of strengths, strategies, study design methods, and potential pitfalls. Examination of big data research examples contained in this article provides insight into the potential and the limitations of this data science revolution and practical pathways for its useful implementation.

Suggested minimums for sample size include from 3 to 20 times the number of variables and absolute ranges from 100 to over 1,000. For the most part, there is little empirical evidence to support these recommendations. This simulation study addressed minimum sample size requirements for 180 different population conditions that varied in the number of factors, the number of variables per factor, and the level of communality. Congruence coefficients were calculated to assess the agreement between population solutions and sample solutions generated from the various population conditions. Although absolute minimums are not presented, it was found that, in general, minimum sample sizes appear to be smaller for higher levels of communality; minimum sample sizes appear to be smaller for higher ratios of the number of variables to the number of factors; and when the variables-to-factors ratio exceeds 6, the minimum sample size begins to stabilize regardless of the number of factors or the level of communality.},

  abstract = {Computationally-intensive, cross-disciplinary research collaborations are difficult to create and maintain over time, though many yield impressive results. The need for researchers to share, maintain, and manage data is increasing, while also integrating new tools and approaches to make their work more impactful. The University Libraries at Virginia Tech has a team of disciplinary data and informatics consultants working to connect research environments on campus with emerging library services enabling collaboration across disciplines. Partnerships with university-level research service providers, such as high-performance computing (HPC) services and statistical data consulting, have presented interesting use cases and innovative solutions to common problems. While traditional library services may not overlap with high performance computing environments, new library services (such as data management, publishing, curation, archiving, and preservation) provide new avenues for collaboration and situate the libraries in a unique position in relation to research ecosystems. Moving large datasets from HPC environments into research environments present significant barriers to research data sharing between collaborators; working with libraries to make these datasets better organized and documented lowers some of these barriers. Discipline-specific informatics consulting allows researchers to integrate new tools and approaches to solve research questions. Here, we highlight the utilization, need, and scope of informatics and research data management services in and around libraries, while also providing examples of how these services have created new collaborations and adoption of improved research practices surrounding data management and integration of computationally intensive techniques (e.g. bioinformatics, humanistic informatics, etc.). This work lays the foundation for these services in an academic setting and the influence of such on the practice and experience of understanding data.},

While reproducibility is core to our definition, most data science learners enter the field with other aspects of data science in mind, for example predictive modelling, which is often one of the most interesting topic to novices. This fact, along with the highly technical nature of the industry standard reproducibility tools currently employed in data science, present out-of-the gate challenges in teaching reproducibility in the data science classroom. Put simply, students are not as intrinsically motivated to learn this topic, and it is not an easy one for them to learn. What can a data science educator do? Over several iterations of teaching courses focused on reproducible data science tools and workflows, we have found that providing extra motivation, guided instruction and lots of practice are key to effectively teaching this challenging, yet important subject. Here we present examples of how we deeply motivate, effectively guide and provide ample practice opportunities to data science students to effectively engage them in learning about this topic.},

  abstract = {There are an ever-increasing number of reports and commentaries that describe the challenges and opportunities associated with the use of big data and data science (DS) in the context of biomedical education, research, and practice. These publications argue that there are substantial benefits resulting from the use of data-centric approaches to solve complex biomedical problems, including an acceleration in the rate of scientific discovery, improved clinical decision making, and the ability to promote healthy behaviors at a population level. In addition, there is an aligned and emerging body of literature that describes the ethical, legal, and social issues that must be addressed to responsibly use big data in such contexts. At the same time, there has been growing recognition that the challenges and opportunities being attributed to the expansion in DS often parallel those experienced by the biomedical informatics community. Indeed, many informaticians would consider some of these issues relevant to the core theories and methods incumbent to the field of biomedical informatics science and practice. In response to this topic area, during the 2016 American College of Medical Informatics Winter Symposium, a series of presentations and focus group discussions intended to define the current state and identify future directions for interaction and collaboration between people who identify themselves as working on big data, DS, and biomedical informatics were conducted. We provide a perspective concerning these discussions and the outcomes of that meeting, and also present a set of recommendations that we have generated in response to a thematic analysis of those same outcomes. Ultimately, this report is intended to: (1) summarize the key issues currently being discussed by the biomedical informatics community as it seeks to better understand how to constructively interact with the emerging biomedical big data and DS fields; and (2) propose a framework and agenda that can serve to advance this type of constructive interaction, with mutual benefit accruing to both fields.},

The Artificial Intelligence in Medicine journal has published theme issues with extended versions of selected AIME papers since 1998. Objectives To review the history of AIME conferences, investigate its impact on the wider research field, and identify challenges for its future. Methods We analyzed a total of 122 session titles to create a taxonomy of research themes and topics. We classified all 734 AIME conference papers published between 1985 and 2013 with this taxonomy. We also analyzed the citations to these conference papers and to 55 special issue papers. Results We identified 30 research topics across 12 themes. AIME was dominated by knowledge engineering research in its first decade, while machine learning and data mining prevailed thereafter. Together these two themes have contributed about 51\% of all papers. There have been eight AIME papers that were cited at least 10 times per year since their publication. Conclusions There has been a major shift from knowledge-based to data-driven methods while the interest for other research themes such as uncertainty management, image and signal processing, and natural language processing has been stable since the early 1990s. AIME papers relating to guidelines and protocols are among the most highly cited.},

The Persona Lifecycle addresses the "how" of creating effective personas and using those personas to design products that people love. It doesn't just describe the value of personas; it offers detailed techniques and tools related to planning, creating, communicating, and using personas to create great product designs. Moreover, it provides rich examples, samples, and illustrations to imitate and model. Perhaps most importantly, it positions personas not as a panacea, but as a method used to complement other user-centered design (UCD) techniques including scenario-based design, cognitive walkthroughs and user testing. The authors developed the Persona Lifecycle model to communicate the value and practical application of personas to product design and development professionals. This book explores the complete lifecycle of personas, to guide the designer at each stage of product development. It includes a running case study with rich examples and samples that demonstrate how personas can be used in building a product end-to-end. It also presents recommended best practices in techniques, tools, and innovative methods and contains hundreds of relevant stories, commentary, opinions, and case studies from user experience professionals across a variety of domains and industries. This book will be a valuable resource for UCD professionals, including usability practitioners, interaction designers, technical writers, and program managers; programmers/developers who act as the interaction designers for software; and those professionals who work with developers and designers.},

This chapter describes the design and structure of a new, unique undergraduate elective course introduced into the curriculum of a large, public University in the Northeastern United States. The design of the course is designed to inspire an ``evidence-based'' mindset, encouraging students to identify and use data relevant to them in their field of study and the larger world around them. The chapter includes the course goals mapped to specific learning objectives, examples of exercises and assignments, a reading list, and a course syllabus. Instructors and institutions interested in bringing data science concepts to a broad audience can use this course as a foundation to build their own curriculum in this area.},

As data scientists seek online spaces to network, learn and share resources with one another, each individual has to employ their own ad-hoc strategy to practice their data science skills. Given these disjointed efforts, it is crucial to ask: how can we build an inclusive, welcoming online community of practice that unites data scientists in their collective efforts to become experts? Daily hashtags on Twitter are used on specific days and have shown promise in forming a community of practice (CoP) in social networking sites like Twitter, but how do they benefit the community and its members? To understand how daily hashtags benefit data scientists and form an online CoP, we conducted a qualitative study on \#TidyTuesday---a daily hashtag project for data scientists using R---using the framework of CoP as a lens for analysis. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 participants and uncovered motivations behind their participation in \#TidyTuesday, how the project benefited them, and how it cultivated an online CoP. Our findings contribute to the CSCW research on community of practices by providing design trade-offs of using daily hashtags on Twitter, and guidelines on growing and sustaining an online community of practice for data scientists.},

  abstract = {This article describes the motivation, design, and progress of the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS). JOSS is a free and open-access journal that publishes articles describing research software. It has the dual goals of improving the quality of the software submitted and providing a mechanism for research software developers to receive credit. While designed to work within the current merit system of science, JOSS addresses the dearth of rewards for key contributions to science made in the form of software. JOSS publishes articles that encapsulate scholarship contained in the software itself, and its rigorous peer review targets the software components: functionality, documentation, tests, continuous integration, and the license. A JOSS article contains an abstract describing the purpose and functionality of the software, references, and a link to the software archive. The article is the entry point of a JOSS submission, which encompasses the full set of software artifacts. Submission and review proceed in the open, on GitHub. Editors, reviewers, and authors work collaboratively and openly. Unlike other journals, JOSS does not reject articles requiring major revision; while not yet accepted, articles remain visible and under review until the authors make adequate changes (or withdraw, if unable to meet requirements). Once an article is accepted, JOSS gives it a digital object identifier (DOI), deposits its metadata in Crossref, and the article can begin collecting citations on indexers like Google Scholar and other services. Authors retain copyright of their JOSS article, releasing it under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. In its first year, starting in May 2016, JOSS published 111 articles, with more than 40 additional articles under review. JOSS is a sponsored project of the nonprofit organization NumFOCUS and is an affiliate of the Open Source Initiative (OSI).},

Nursing students, as future healthcare providers, should be skilled in locating, using and evaluating online health information. Aim The main purpose of this study was to assess eHealth literacy among nursing students in Jordan, as well as to explore factors associated with eHealth literacy. Methods A descriptive cross sectional survey was conducted in two universities in Jordan, one public and one private. A total of 541 students completed the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS). Some additional personal and demographical variables were collected to explore their relation to eHealth literacy. Results Students have a moderate self-perceived level of eHealth literacy (M=3.62, SD=0.58). They are aware of the available online health resources and know how to search, locate, and use these resources. Yet, they lack skills to evaluate them and cannot differentiate between high and low quality resources. Factors that are related to eHealth literacy include type of university, type of student admission, academic level, students' internet skills, and their perception of the usefulness and importance of the internet. On the other hand, age, gender, grade point average (GPA), and frequency of internet use were found not to significantly affect eHealth literacy. Conclusion This study represents a baseline reference for eHealth literacy in Jordan. Students have some of the necessary skills, while others still need to be improved. Nursing educators and administrators should incorporate eHealth literacy skills into the curriculum.},

The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals.

  abstract = {Determining sample size requirements for structural equation modeling (SEM) is a challenge often faced by investigators, peer reviewers, and grant writers. Recent years have seen a large increase in SEMs in the behavioral science literature, but consideration of sample size requirements for applied SEMs often relies on outdated rules-of-thumb. This study used Monte Carlo data simulation techniques to evaluate sample size requirements for common applied SEMs. Across a series of simulations, we systematically varied key model properties, including number of indicators and factors, magnitude of factor loadings and path coefficients, and amount of missing data. We investigated how changes in these parameters affected sample size requirements with respect to statistical power, bias in the parameter estimates, and overall solution propriety. Results revealed a range of sample size requirements (i.e., from 30 to 460 cases), meaningful patterns of association between parameters and sample size, and highlight the limitations of commonly cited rules-of-thumb. The broad ``lessons learned'' for determining SEM sample size requirements are discussed.},
