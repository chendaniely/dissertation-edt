It’s better for everyone if the tools used for research and science are free and open. Reproducibility, widespread sharing of knowledge and techniques, and the leveling of the playing field by eliminating cost barriers are but a few of the shared benefits of free software in science.},

  abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are widely used to deliver specialized education and training in different fields. Determining the effectiveness of these courses is an integral part of delivering comprehensive, high-quality learning. This study is an evaluation of a MOOC offered by Imperial College London in collaboration with Health iQ called, Data Science Essentials: Real World Evidence. The paper analyzes the reported learning outcomes, attitudes and behaviours of students after completing the MOOC. The study used mixed-methods, drawing from a Kirkpatrick evaluation-using data from semi-structured interviews transcribed and analyzed through Braun and Clark's method for thematic coding. 191 learners joined the MOOC. Two participants who completed at least 75\% of the course were interviewed for the course evaluation. The findings of the analysis suggest that the course attracted target learners and learners found its application and engagement methods effective. Learners found the training provided by the MOOC to be helpful and with the potential to be applied in their work environment in the future and identified some work-related barriers that prevent knowledge application. Networking during and post-MOOC was identified as an area that needs improvement and development in the future. Findings derived from this evaluation support the fact that generally, MOOCs can improve learning and knowledge attainment in practical skills-based knowledge. One implication of this study is to inform factors that engage learners in the design and implementation of MOOC. The findings have shown that factors that affect the learners' engagement are the availability of lecture videos, self-assessment tools and high networking and communication between learners. In terms of knowledge application, support and availability of the right resources are essential because learners are not able to apply learning in their workplace if the workplace lacked the right resources and support. Developers of MOOCs for continuing professional development should take into consideration work-related barriers when designing their MOOCs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Interest in CI training opportunities (medical school electives, residency electives, or academic fellowships) surpassed respondents’ prior awareness of these opportunities. Thirty percent of student respondents expressed at least some interest in a CI-related career, but they were no more aware of training opportunities than their peers who did not express such an interest.Discussion Almost one third of medical students who responded to our survey expressed an interest in a CI-related career, but they were generally unaware of CI training and mentoring opportunities available to them. Early outreach to such medical students, through elective classes, professional society incentives, or expert partnerships, may positively influence the size and skill set of the future CI workforce.Conclusion We should work as a field to increase the quantity, quality, and publicity of CI learning opportunities for interested medical students.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The movement of evidence-based practices (EBPs) into routine clinical usage is not spontaneous, but requires focused efforts. The field of implementation science has developed to facilitate the spread of EBPs, including both psychosocial and medical interventions for mental and physical health concerns. DISCUSSION: The authors aim to introduce implementation science principles to non-specialist investigators, administrators, and policymakers seeking to become familiar with this emerging field. This introduction is based on published literature and the authors' experience as researchers in the field, as well as extensive service as implementation science grant reviewers. Implementation science is "the scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other EBPs into routine practice, and, hence, to improve the quality and effectiveness of health services." Implementation science is distinct from, but shares characteristics with, both quality improvement and dissemination methods. Implementation studies can be either assess naturalistic variability or measure change in response to planned intervention. Implementation studies typically employ mixed quantitative-qualitative designs, identifying factors that impact uptake across multiple levels, including patient, provider, clinic, facility, organization, and often the broader community and policy environment. Accordingly, implementation science requires a solid grounding in theory and the involvement of trans-disciplinary research teams. The business case for implementation science is clear: As healthcare systems work under increasingly dynamic and resource-constrained conditions, evidence-based strategies are essential in order to ensure that research investments maximize healthcare value and improve public health. Implementation science plays a critical role in supporting these efforts.},

Using the open source Pandas library, you can use Python to rapidly automate and perform virtually any data analysis task, no matter how large or complex. Pandas can help you ensure the veracity of your data, visualize it for effective decision-making, and reliably reproduce analyses across multiple datasets. ~ Pandas for Everyone brings together practical knowledge and insight for solving real problems with Pandas, even if you’re new to Python data analysis. Daniel Y. Chen introduces key concepts through simple but practical examples, incrementally building on them to solve more difficult, real-world problems. ~ Chen gives you a jumpstart on using Pandas with a realistic dataset and covers combining datasets, handling missing data, and structuring datasets for easier analysis and visualization. He demonstrates powerful data cleaning techniques, from basic string manipulation to applying functions simultaneously across dataframes. ~ Once your data is ready, Chen guides you through fitting models for prediction, clustering, inference, and exploration. He provides tips on performance and scalability, and introduces you to the wider Python data analysis ecosystem.~   Work with DataFrames and Series, and import or export data Create plots with matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas Combine datasets and handle missing data Reshape, tidy, and clean datasets so they’re easier to work with Convert data types and manipulate text strings Apply functions to scale data manipulations Aggregate, transform, and filter large datasets with groupby Leverage Pandas’ advanced date and time capabilities Fit linear models using statsmodels and scikit-learn libraries Use generalized linear modeling to fit models with different response variables Compare multiple models to select the “best” Regularize to overcome overfitting and improve performance Use clustering in unsupervised machine learning},

We provide an analysis of the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) training program strengths and weaknesses with an eye toward future directions aimed at any funder and potential funding recipient worldwide. The focus is on extramurally funded programs that have a national or international impact rather than the training of NIH staff, which was addressed by the NIH’s internal Data Science Workforce Development Center. From its inception, the major goal of BD2K was to narrow the gap between needed and existing biomedical data science skills. As biomedical research increasingly relies on computational, mathematical, and statistical thinking, supporting the training and education of the workforce of tomorrow requires new emphases on analytical skills. From 2013 to 2016, BD2K jump-started training in this area for all levels, from graduate students to senior researchers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {Environmental research requires understanding nonlinear ecological dynamics that interact across multiple spatial and temporal scales. The analysis of long-term and high-frequency sensor data combined with simulation modeling enables interpretation of complex ecological phenomena, and the computational skills needed to conduct these analyses are increasingly being integrated into graduate student training programs in ecology. Despite its importance, however, computational literacy—that is, the ability to harness the power of computer technologies to accomplish tasks—is rarely taught in undergraduate ecology classrooms, representing a major gap in training students to tackle complex environmental challenges. Through our experience developing undergraduate curricula in long-term and high-frequency data analysis and simulation modeling for two environmental science pedagogical initiatives, Project EDDIE (Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry and Exploration) and Macrosystems EDDIE, we have found that students often feel intimidated by computational tasks, which is compounded by the lack of familiarity with software (e.g., R) and the steep learning curves associated with script-based analytical tools. The use of prepackaged, flexible modules that introduce programming as a mechanism to explore environmental datasets and teach inquiry-based ecology, such as those developed for Project EDDIE and Macrosystems EDDIE, can significantly increase students’ experience and comfort levels with advanced computational tools. These types of modules in turn provide great potential for empowering students with the computational literacy needed to ask ecological questions and test hypotheses on their own. As continental-scale sensor observatory networks rapidly expand the availability of long-term and high-frequency data, students with the skills to manipulate, visualize, and interpret such data will be well-prepared for diverse careers in data science, and will help advance the future of open, reproducible science in ecology.},

  abstract = {To increase the effectiveness of graduate research training, many universities have introduced boot camps and bridge programs lasting several days to several weeks. National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health currently support such interventions with nearly \$28 million in active awards. Previous evidence for the efficacy of this format exists primarily in the form of anecdotes and end-of-course surveys. Here we show that participation in such short-format interventions is not associated with observable benefits related to skill development, scholarly productivity, or socialization into the academic community. Analyzing data from 294 PhD students in life sciences from 53 US institutions, we found no evidence of effectiveness across 115 variables. We conclude that boot camps and other short formats may not durably impact student outcomes., Many PhD programs incorporate boot camps and summer bridge programs to accelerate the development of doctoral students’ research skills and acculturation into their respective disciplines. These brief, high-intensity experiences span no more than several weeks and are typically designed to expose graduate students to data analysis techniques, to develop scientific writing skills, and to better embed incoming students into the scholarly community. However, there is no previous study that directly measures the outcomes of PhD students who participate in such programs and compares them to the outcomes of students who did not participate. Likewise, no previous study has used a longitudinal design to assess these outcomes over time. Here we show that participation in such programs is not associated with detectable benefits related to skill development, socialization into the academic community, or scholarly productivity for students in our sample. Analyzing data from 294 PhD students in the life sciences from 53 US institutions, we found no statistically significant differences in outcomes between participants and nonparticipants across 115 variables. These results stand in contrast to prior studies presenting boot camps as effective interventions based on participant satisfaction and perceived value. Many universities and government agencies (e.g., National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation) invest substantial resources in boot camp and summer bridge activities in the hopes of better supporting scientific workforce development. Our findings do not reveal any measurable benefits to students, indicating that an allocation of limited resources to alternative strategies with stronger empirical foundations warrants consideration.},

  abstract = {A modern evidence and value-driven healthcare system must have the capacity to learn and adapt—to track performance in real-time and generate and apply information for future improvements in safety, quality, and value of care received. As information technologies supporting clinical documentation continue to advance, the volume of clinical data generated in the natural course of care rapidly grows. Understanding, accessing, managing, and interpreting the widening variety of healthcare data available requires coordination of resources, efforts, and incentives to ensure that researchers, clinicians, and patients have access to the right data, in the right context, at the right time (Detmer, 2003; Kawamoto and Ginsburg, 2009; NRC, 2009). Integrated datasets and other approaches to link data and broaden or share findings only extend the potential to use these data to learn what works in health care. Fostering broader access to and appropriate use of these data will be key to progress—and will require both cross-sector discussions to better characterize the technical, organizational, and legal barriers that currently limit the use of existing and emerging data resources and cooperative action to address these challenges (Arrow et al., 2009; Piwowar et al., 2008). These and other issues were the focus of discussion at the Institute of Medicine (IOM) Roundtable on Value \& Science-Driven Health Care’s February 2008 workshop, Clinical Data as the Basic Staple of Health Learning: Creating and Protecting a Public Good (Box 1-1).},

In recent years, a number of peer-reviewed articles have addressed different dimensions of data mining application in healthcare. However, the lack of a comprehensive and systematic narrative motivated us to construct a literature review on this topic. In this paper, we present a review of the literature on healthcare analytics using data mining and big data. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a database search between 2005 and 2016. Critical elements of the selected studies\&mdash;healthcare sub-areas, data mining techniques, types of analytics, data, and data sources\&mdash;were extracted to provide a systematic view of development in this field and possible future directions. We found that the existing literature mostly examines analytics in clinical and administrative decision-making. Use of human-generated data is predominant considering the wide adoption of Electronic Medical Record in clinical care. However, analytics based on website and social media data has been increasing in recent years. Lack of prescriptive analytics in practice and integration of domain expert knowledge in the decision-making process emphasizes the necessity of future research.},

  abstract = {Introduction Data Carpentry is a fiscally sponsored project of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit that supports world-class, innovative, open source scientific computing projects. The mission of Data Carpentry is to provide researchers high-quality, domain-specific training covering the full lifecycle of data-driven research. This mission is achieved through the development and implementation of workshops taught on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research. Data Carpentry is a sibling organization of Software Carpentry, though its focus is on the introductory computational skills needed for data management and analysis in all domains of research. Data Carpentry lessons are domain specific, and range from life and physical sciences to social science. Lessons build upon the existing knowledge of learners to enable them to quickly apply the skills they learn to their own research. Data Carpentry learners are asked to complete pre- and post-workshop surveys. This report is an analysis of the post-workshop survey responses collected for 40 Data Carpentry workshop sites. Purpose The analysis in this report serves the following purposes: To inform the community of the impact Data Carpentry workshops have made on its learners. To provide context for the survey responses as they relate to Data Carpentry learners. To discuss what Data Carpentry is doing well, areas of improvement, and questions we should be asking.},

However, the available software for implementing and disseminating such surveys lacks flexibility, stifling researcher creativity and severely limiting the scope of questions that survey research can address. In this paper I introduce the use of R Shiny, an open source web application and scripting language, for implementing powerful, innovative, and fully customizable surveys. Through six applications rooted in important questions in political science, I show that R Shiny allows for (1) randomized question selection, (2) programmatic treatments, (3) programmatic survey flow, (4) adaptive question batteries, (5) sequentially block-randomized design, and (6) randomized intracoder reliability tests, expanding the scope, ease, and cost effectiveness of online survey research. I make all replication code available online.},

Here, the program is described and compared to standard data science curricula as they were organized in 2014 and 2015. We show that novel pedagogical and administrative decisions introduced in our program are now standard in online data science programs. The impact of the Data Science Specialization on data science education in the U.S. is also discussed. Finally, we conclude with some thoughts about the future of data science education in a data democratized world.},

This study aimed to identify factors related to greater risk of and earlier hospitalizations from HH, a key step in targeting preventive efforts.{$<$}bold{$>$}Methods: {$<$}/bold{$>$}Data come from Medicare mandated start-of-care assessments from 87,780 HH patients served by 132 agencies in 32 states, collected from January 2013 to March 2015. Using parametric accelerated failure time (AFT) survival models, we evaluated the association between key patient and environmental characteristics and the hazard of and time until hospitalization and re-hospitalization.{$<$}bold{$>$}Results: {$<$}/bold{$>$}In total, 15,030 hospitalizations, including 6,539 re-hospitalizations, occurred in the sample within 60 days of start of HH. Factors most strongly associated with substantially greater risk of and earlier hospitalization included male gender, history of hospitalization, polypharmacy, elevated depressive symptoms, greater functional disability, primary diagnoses of heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and urinary tract infection, and government-controlled agency care. In addition to these factors, black race and primary diagnosis of skin wounds were uniquely related to risk of earlier re-hospitalization.{$<$}bold{$>$}Conclusions: {$<$}/bold{$>$}Results suggest that factors collected during routine HH patient assessments can provide important information to predict risk of earlier hospitalization and re-hospitalization among Medicare HH patients. Identified factors can help identify patients at greatest risk of early hospitalization and may be important targets for agencies and care providers to prevent avoidable hospitalizations.

  abstract = {Technical advances in science have had broad implications in reproductive and women's health care. Recent innovations in population-level data collection and storage have made available an unprecedented amount of data for analysis while computational technology has evolved to permit processing of data previously thought too dense to study. "Big data" is a term used to describe data that are a combination of dramatically greater volume, complexity, and scale. The number of variables in typical big data research can readily be in the thousands, challenging the limits of traditional research methodologies. Regardless of what it is called, advanced data methods, predictive analytics, or big data, this unprecedented revolution in scientific exploration has the potential to dramatically assist research in obstetrics and gynecology broadly across subject matter. Before implementation of big data research methodologies, however, potential researchers and reviewers should be aware of strengths, strategies, study design methods, and potential pitfalls. Examination of big data research examples contained in this article provides insight into the potential and the limitations of this data science revolution and practical pathways for its useful implementation.

  abstract = {Computationally-intensive, cross-disciplinary research collaborations are difficult to create and maintain over time, though many yield impressive results. The need for researchers to share, maintain, and manage data is increasing, while also integrating new tools and approaches to make their work more impactful. The University Libraries at Virginia Tech has a team of disciplinary data and informatics consultants working to connect research environments on campus with emerging library services enabling collaboration across disciplines. Partnerships with university-level research service providers, such as high-performance computing (HPC) services and statistical data consulting, have presented interesting use cases and innovative solutions to common problems. While traditional library services may not overlap with high performance computing environments, new library services (such as data management, publishing, curation, archiving, and preservation) provide new avenues for collaboration and situate the libraries in a unique position in relation to research ecosystems. Moving large datasets from HPC environments into research environments present significant barriers to research data sharing between collaborators; working with libraries to make these datasets better organized and documented lowers some of these barriers. Discipline-specific informatics consulting allows researchers to integrate new tools and approaches to solve research questions. Here, we highlight the utilization, need, and scope of informatics and research data management services in and around libraries, while also providing examples of how these services have created new collaborations and adoption of improved research practices surrounding data management and integration of computationally intensive techniques (e.g. bioinformatics, humanistic informatics, etc.). This work lays the foundation for these services in an academic setting and the influence of such on the practice and experience of understanding data.},

The Persona Lifecycle addresses the "how" of creating effective personas and using those personas to design products that people love. It doesn’t just describe the value of personas; it offers detailed techniques and tools related to planning, creating, communicating, and using personas to create great product designs. Moreover, it provides rich examples, samples, and illustrations to imitate and model. Perhaps most importantly, it positions personas not as a panacea, but as a method used to complement other user-centered design (UCD) techniques including scenario-based design, cognitive walkthroughs and user testing. The authors developed the Persona Lifecycle model to communicate the value and practical application of personas to product design and development professionals. This book explores the complete lifecycle of personas, to guide the designer at each stage of product development. It includes a running case study with rich examples and samples that demonstrate how personas can be used in building a product end-to-end. It also presents recommended best practices in techniques, tools, and innovative methods and contains hundreds of relevant stories, commentary, opinions, and case studies from user experience professionals across a variety of domains and industries. This book will be a valuable resource for UCD professionals, including usability practitioners, interaction designers, technical writers, and program managers; programmers/developers who act as the interaction designers for software; and those professionals who work with developers and designers.},

The design of the course is designed to inspire an “evidence-based” mindset, encouraging students to identify and use data relevant to them in their field of study and the larger world around them. The chapter includes the course goals mapped to specific learning objectives, examples of exercises and assignments, a reading list, and a course syllabus. Instructors and institutions interested in bringing data science concepts to a broad audience can use this course as a foundation to build their own curriculum in this area.},

  abstract = {This article describes the motivation, design, and progress of the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS). JOSS is a free and open-access journal that publishes articles describing research software. It has the dual goals of improving the quality of the software submitted and providing a mechanism for research software developers to receive credit. While designed to work within the current merit system of science, JOSS addresses the dearth of rewards for key contributions to science made in the form of software. JOSS publishes articles that encapsulate scholarship contained in the software itself, and its rigorous peer review targets the software components: functionality, documentation, tests, continuous integration, and the license. A JOSS article contains an abstract describing the purpose and functionality of the software, references, and a link to the software archive. The article is the entry point of a JOSS submission, which encompasses the full set of software artifacts. Submission and review proceed in the open, on GitHub. Editors, reviewers, and authors work collaboratively and openly. Unlike other journals, JOSS does not reject articles requiring major revision; while not yet accepted, articles remain visible and under review until the authors make adequate changes (or withdraw, if unable to meet requirements). Once an article is accepted, JOSS gives it a digital object identifier (DOI), deposits its metadata in Crossref, and the article can begin collecting citations on indexers like Google Scholar and other services. Authors retain copyright of their JOSS article, releasing it under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. In its first year, starting in May 2016, JOSS published 111 articles, with more than 40 additional articles under review. JOSS is a sponsored project of the nonprofit organization NumFOCUS and is an affiliate of the Open Source Initiative (OSI).},

Nursing students, as future healthcare providers, should be skilled in locating, using and evaluating online health information. Aim The main purpose of this study was to assess eHealth literacy among nursing students in Jordan, as well as to explore factors associated with eHealth literacy. Methods A descriptive cross sectional survey was conducted in two universities in Jordan, one public and one private. A total of 541 students completed the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS). Some additional personal and demographical variables were collected to explore their relation to eHealth literacy. Results Students have a moderate self-perceived level of eHealth literacy (M=3.62, SD=0.58). They are aware of the available online health resources and know how to search, locate, and use these resources. Yet, they lack skills to evaluate them and cannot differentiate between high and low quality resources. Factors that are related to eHealth literacy include type of university, type of student admission, academic level, students' internet skills, and their perception of the usefulness and importance of the internet. On the other hand, age, gender, grade point average (GPA), and frequency of internet use were found not to significantly affect eHealth literacy. Conclusion This study represents a baseline reference for eHealth literacy in Jordan. Students have some of the necessary skills, while others still need to be improved. Nursing educators and administrators should incorporate eHealth literacy skills into the curriculum.},

  abstract = {There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders—representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers—have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},

Due to the distinguishing characteristics of big data, it is commonly stored and processed using NoSQL (Not Only SQL) database systems. Big data has been utilised in various applications and services ranging from E-commerce through to social media to public sector and governmental organisations. The goal of this editorial note is to provide a concise summary of the big data characteristics, models, and technologies and to identify some of the crucial research challenges that are open for further research.}
