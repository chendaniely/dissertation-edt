\subsection{Emerging Technologies}

    Data science's reach goes beyond any single domain and technology stack.
    The Julia language (Rank \#36 on the TIOBE index in November 2021)
    was released in 2012 with the goal of being a high-level and fast programming language,
    especially around numerical computing.
    It was Incorporated in the Jupyter ecosystem as a way to unify computational languages into a single
    development environment for data science tasks.
    Julia's \code{dataframes.jl} library was released in 2012, giving the same data manipulating
    features as the R dataframe object and Python's \code{pandas} library.
    
    Representing a dataframe object across multiple programming languages is a challenge because of
    how array objects are implement from language to language.
    The Apache Arrow project aims to create a centralized API for dataframes that can be used across multiple languages,
    allowing end users to use whatever tool best suits their needs,
    but using a unified and performant data structure
    \cite{ApacheArrow}.
    Groups like Ursa Labs were formed in 2018 (now Voltron Data in 2021) to help provide
    more support to the Apache Arrow project
    \cite{UrsaLabs, VoltronData}.
    
    JavaScript's popularity over the years (Rank \#7 on the TIOBE index in November 2021)
    stem from it connection with end user interactions with
    virtually all websites on the internet.
    It has become a tool for creating interactive figures (e.g., \code{D3.js}) for people on the internet.
    Since virtual every person who connects to the internet uses a web browser,
    WebAssembly was announced in 2015 as an open standard for any programming language
    to compile down for web applications
    \cite{WebAssembly}.
    
    Projects like Apache Arrow and WebAssembly are blurring the lines between tools needed for data science tasks.
