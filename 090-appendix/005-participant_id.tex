Participants were asked to create a unique identifier to track them throughout all studies without
having to capture any identifiable information.

The question they were asked was adapted from the same question used in The Carpentries
workshop feedback questions. %TODO Cite
Below is a reproduction of the question presented to participants:

\begin{displayquote}
    Please create a unique identifier.
    This unique identifier will be used to link your survey responses but keep your personal information anonymous.

    To create an identifier type in:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Number of siblings (as numeric) +
        \item First two (2) letters of the city you were born in (lower-case) +
        \item First three (3) letters of your current street (lower-case).
    \end{enumerate}

    E.g., Sherlock Homes has \textbf{1} brother,
    was born in \textbf{Po}rsmoth,
    and lives on \textbf{Bac}ker street would have the ID: \textbf{1pobac}
\end{displayquote}
